# Changing VLC's Playlist Path

1. If you want to make sure the playlist plays properly without errors, you should change `<location>file:///X:/source/folder/somefile.mkv</location> to <location>file:///./somefile.mkv</location>.`
2. Just change it for all files using text editor. So it will work if you change the name of directory or change the disk.
